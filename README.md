  * Mon 2:30pm -- 4:15pm, MWW LT1
  * ESTR: Wed 2:30pm -- 3:15pm, MMW 702
- Tutorials:

### Grading
| Assessment item | ENGG Weight | ESTR Weight
| :---------------- | :--- | :--- | 
| Homework* | 30% (5%x6) | 20% (4%x5)
| Tutorial participation | 5% | 0%
| Midterm | 30%  | 30%
| Final Exam | 35% | 30%
| Project | 0% | 15%

\*: Each week one homework will be released on Monday the latest. Submit your solutions by Wednesday midnight. We will discuss the homework on Thursday in tutorials, and release your marks by end of the week. For ENGG students, each homework is 5%; we will use your 6 highest marks as the total; for ESTR students, each homework is 4%; we will use your 5 highest marks as the total.

### ESTR 2018 students
ESTR 2018 follows the same format as ENGG 2760A, but with additional readings and exercises, and a project to be presented in the second half of the semester. The exams and quizzes will be the same as ENGG 2760A.

Projects can be done individually or with a partner. They will involve a short report and a presentation. The readings and exercises can be used as project leads, but you can feel free to choose your own topic in consultation with the course instructor or the TAs.

### Textbook
The primary reference for this course is [Introduction to Probability (2nd edition)](http://athenasc.com/probbook.html) by Bertsekas and Tsitsiklis. Notes will be provided for additional material.

## Course policies
- *Special teaching arrangement* for students who cannot enter HK:
  * ENGG 2760A: recordings will be provided on this site after each lecture and tutorial. They will also be available on Blackboard.
  * ESTR 2018: both live Zoom sessions and recordings will be provided on this site for each lecture and tutorial.
  * Inform the course instructor, Henry, **immediately** when you can physically attend the class, so we can avoid the hassle of hybrid mode teaching.
- Homework and project: 
  * Submit via Blackboard. You are automatically enrolled in the Blackboard course. We will create entries specifically for each item, and they will close automatically after the deadline. Marks will be available by end of weekend also on Blackboard.
  * Submit PDF files only. Other file format will be marked as zero. You can handwrite and scan as PDF, or simply write your solution using [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/) (All our homework and solutions are written in LaTeX).
  * No late submission. No exception.
  * According to the University’s regulation, every assignment must be accompanied by a signed declaration of originality; submissions without it will receive zero mark.
  * The declaration form is available [here](http://www.cuhk.edu.hk/policy/academichonesty/Eng_htm_files_(2013-14)/declaration_en.doc).
- Lecture and tutorial:
  * Be on time. Set your mobile device to vibration/silient mode.
  * Feel free to ask questions and raise comments during the lecture, but we can only entertain short questions and discussions in-class.
