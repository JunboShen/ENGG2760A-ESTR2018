## ESTR 2018 students
ESTR 2018 follows the same format as ENGG 2760A, but with additional readings and exercises, and a project to be presented in the second half of the semester. The exams and quizzes will be the same as ENGG 2760A.

Projects can be done individually or with a partner. They will involve a short report and a presentation. The readings and exercises can be used as project leads, but you can feel free to choose your own topic in consultation with the course instructor or the TAs.
